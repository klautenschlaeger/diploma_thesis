\ac{WIC} describes a wireless data exchange between agricultural machines in the field.
A prototypical use case is an Agricultural Platooning Service, which exchanges guidance data positions following
vehicles in a platoon with a lateral and longitudinal offset to a leading vehicle in the field.
This thesis investigates the suitability of modern Wi-Fi for \ac{WIC} based on the use case Agricultural Platooning Service.
I analyzed process data and derived requirements of Agricultural Platooning Services in the the corn harvest scenario.

Field measurements in an agricultural environment indicated that Wi-Fi communication can range up to \SI{2500}{\metre} in
a line-of-sight scenario.
However, signal strength can suffer from multipath, shadowing and fading effects due to the
agricultural environment and the machine sizes.


I simulated different Wi-Fi physical layer configurations that reduce the data rate but
enable robust communication to overcome these challenges.
The results enable configuration for long-range service discovery and Uniform Guidance Data exchange modes
in the Agricultural Platooning Service.
Finally, it was shown that the required latencies and message intervals for Agricultural Platooning Services could be met in the corn harvest
scenario.
