# Suitability of Modern Wi-Fi for Wireless-Infield-Communication of Agricultural Machines

### Abstract

Wireless Infield Communication (WIC) describes a wireless data exchange
between agricultural machines in the field. A prototypical use case 
is an Agricultural Platooning Service, which exchanges guidance data to position following vehicles in a platoon with a
lateral and longitudinal offset to a leading vehicle in the field.

This thesis investigates the suitability of modern Wi-Fi for WIC based on
the use case Agricultural Platooning Service. I analyzed process data and derived requirements of
Agricultural Platooning Services in the corn harvest scenario. 
Field measurements in an agricultural environment indicated that
Wi-Fi communication can range up to 2500 m in a line-of-sight scenario. 
However, signal strength can suffer from multipath, shadowing and fading effects due to the agricultural 
environment and the machine sizes.

I simulated different Wi-Fi physical layer configurations that 
reduce the data rate but enable robust communication to overcome
these challenges. The results enable configuration for long-range
service discovery and uniform guidance data exchange modes 
in the Agricultural Platooning Service.
Finally, it was shown that the required latencies and message
intervals for Agricultural Platooning Services could be met in 
the corn harvest scenario.
