\section{\acl{WIC}}
Given that there are many different agricultural technology companies worldwide and  mix of their machines is often used together in an agricultural company, a demand for interoperability between agricultural machines of different brands emerged. In 2008, the \ac{AEF} was founded to develop and standardize this interoperability w\footnote{https://www.aef-online.org/about-us/about-the-aef.html Accessed: 24.07.2022}.

The AEF has defined a binary unit system, the ISO 11783 standard, for agricultural machinery communication, mainly tractors and implements \cite{iglesias_enabling_2014}. According to \textcite{schlingmann_aef_2019}, the ISO 11783 standard is known as the ISOBUS system.

The authors mention that the AEF is currently working on other issues. Among them is also the \ac{WIC}. In the associated project group \ac{WIC}, solutions for \ac{M2M} communication between cooperating, agricultural machines are to be developed and standardized.

For this purpose, the authors name the following use cases:
\input{wic.tex}

Considering that I investigate the Suitability of modern Wifi for Wireless-Infield-Communication and Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 5 are no long range technologies, I will focus on investigating the suitability of these two Wi-Fi standards for the \ac{WIC} use cases Real-Time Machine-to-Machine Control and Streaming Services. Throughout this thesis, I will refer to real-time machine-to-machine control as Agricultural Platooning.

In order to implement these described \ac{WIC} use cases, the \ac{WIC} project group has been searching for a technology that can realize the required data rates, latencies and high transmission range. The plans for doing so are written down by members of the \ac{WIC} project group in \cite{schlingmann_challenges_2017}.

The authors consider the fundamental use of cellular networks as very problematic because, according to \cite{noauthor_ict_2016}, only \SI{30}{\percent} of the land surface has network coverage. For this reason, there is a major concern that the required data cannot be exchanged because there is no network connectivity in many fields. Nevertheless, the authors want to leave the future \ac{WIC} system open to cellular standards.

The current focus of the authors is on IEEE 802.11 technologies, which must first be evaluated for use in the agricultural environment.

In collaboration with \textcite{klingler_agriculture_2018}, the authors investigated IEEE 802.11p technology for \ac{WIC} in agricultural scenarios. Experiments revealed that data could be exchanged over a maximum range of \SI{1700}{\metre}. But during the measurement in an agricultural work scenario from the corn harvest, there were collapses in the Received Signal Strength due to shadowing effects of the machines. The high range, data rate, and possible latencies make IEEE 802.11p a good technology for \ac{WIC} according to \textcite{schlingmann_challenges_2017}.

As of July 2, 2021, the frequency spectrum of IEEE 802.11p in the United States of America, ranging from \SIrange{5,850}{5,925}{\giga\hertz}, has been split. The upper \SI{30}{\mega\hertz} are reserved for Intelligent transportation systems now. The lower \SI{45}{\mega\hertz} have been released for unlicensed operations \cite{noauthor_use_2021}.

Since the use of IEEE 802.11p has now been newly regulated by the FCC, the \ac{WIC} project group is looking for an alternative technology that enables \ac{WIC}.
\section{Wireless Lans according to IEEE 802.11}
\todo{Paper Christoph Sommer, Doktorarbeit, Diplomarbeit, Mario Franke, Tobias Hardes}
According to \textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002} the first version of the Standard IEEE 802.11 was published in 1999 to enable a wireless alternative to Ethernet - or Token-Ring - networks.
\textcite{sauter_wireless_2022} considers IEEE 802.11 also to be an implementation of Ethernet with the help of wirless radio technologies. The author lists the extensions to the original standard, which range from 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11a, 802.11n, 802.11ac to the latest enhancement 802.11ax. The different IEEE 802.11 standards can operate in the  \SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz} - , \SI{5}{\giga\hertz} and \SI{6}{\giga\hertz} - frequency band. 


\textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002} defines the following three basic architectures for IEEE 802.11.

If two or more stations communicate directly without an AP, they form an ad hoc network. According to the author, this can be set up quickly and easily and is also called \ac{IBSS}.

The Infrastructure \ac{BSS} mode allows all stations within the range of defined range around the \ac{AP} to communicate via a central \ac{AP}. Within the area of the \ac{BSS}, all stations can move freely and communicate with one another.

Since an \ac{AP} has limited range and can only cover a certain area, the \ac{ESS} was introduced. It contains a distribution system, which links several \ac{BSS} with each other.

Thereby, the BSS coverage areas can physically overlap so that continuous connection of stations within the ESS can be provided. For a better performance the \ac{BSS} can be placed physically on top of each other. One can also have physically separate \ac{BSS}s so that these \ac{BSS}s can be linked together over long distances. According to the author, the standard does not specify a distance limit for such connections. 

He also mentions, that the standard defines the following three mobility types for station in an \ac{ESS}, where a station can do no-transition and thereby stay within a \ac{BSS}, \ac{BSS}-transitioning and move from one \ac{BSS} to another \ac{BSS} within the same \ac{ESS} and \ac{ESS}-transition, where the Station moves from a \ac{ESS} to another one but no stable connection can be guaranteed.

\textcite{sauter_wireless_2022} adds, that usually Ethernet is used to link \ac{AP}s in within an \ac{ESS}. But according to the author this can be replaced by a wireless connection, which is called wireless bridge.
\TODO{Sauter 2022 Ad-Hoc Infos}
The further development of IEEE 802.11 is accompanied by a constant change of the physical layer. \textcite{sauter_wireless_2022} mentions, that all new enhancements of the physical layer of IEEE 802.11 are backward compatible to previous definitions of the it.

According to the Author, IEEE 802.11 initially used DSSS and FHSS as modulation methods.
Since IEEE 802.11g the modulation method \ac{OFDM} can be used in the \SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz} frequency band. \ac{OFDM} divides the transmission channel in subcarriers with different amplitudes, frequencies and phases. Each subcarrier is orthogonal to another one, as they send the information "Low", where only one other subcarrier is sending the information "High".
For the modulation and demodulation the FFT and IFFT are used respectively.
\textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002} states, that \ac{OFDM} can be used in the \SI{5}{\giga\hertz} frequency band since IEEE 802.11a.

Convolutional encoders are used to increase redundancy. This enables \ac{FEC}, which can distribute a bit sequence over the \ac{OFDM} subcarriers in such a way that an original bit sequence can be decoded at the receiver even in the event of interference. \textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002}


Various \ac{MCS}s can be selected in the physical layer in order to transmit as many bits as possible in the signal. 
These \ac{MCS}s are based on \ac{PSK} or \ac{QAM}. 
\textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002} recommends setting the parameters in an \ac{OFDM} system in such a way that first the coding rate and then the complexity of the \ac{MCS} is reduced in difficult transmission environments.\TODO{Viel aus gleichem Lehrbuch Quellen? / Lieblingsautor / }
An imaginary, theoretical transmission channel is usually specified as a square-wave signal in the frequency domain with the limits of both minimum and maximum amplitude and cut-off frequency. \textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002} defines the roll-off factor as a cosine-shaped flattening of the square signal between 0 and 1. In addition, the author points out that \ac{QAM} can generate high roll-off factors, so that signals interfere significantly more with adjacent channels.
The author recommends increasing the frequency spacing between transmission channels.

The next layer in the OSI model is the Data Link Layer.
The Data Link Layer consists of Medium Access - and Logic Link Control functionalities.


According to \textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002}, the medium access control functionalities cover network entry - ,network authentication - and media access methods.
The author explains, that every \ac{AP} send beacon frames periodically to synchronise its stations in the \ac{BSS} and that the beacon frame contains the \ac{SSID}, which identifies the \ac{BSS} or \ac{ESS} of the station. \textcite{sauter_wireless_2022} adds that a beacon frame contains a \SI{16}{\bit} - long capability information element. Each bit here signals that the \ac{AP} provides a particular function or has a specific feature. 

\textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002} explains the procedure for network entry of a station. A station can use the passive or the active scanning mode. In passive scanning mode, the station listens for a beacon frame in the various transmission channels. Alternatively, in active scanning mode, a station can also send out a probe frame. This can contain an already known \ac{SSID} to test the presence of the \ac{AP}. To get an \ac{AP} in range, the probe-frame can also contain a broadcast SSID that causes all nearby \ac{AP}s to respond. The response of an \ac{AP} to the probe frame is the probe-response frame, which contains the same information as a beacon frame. With the information from the beacon frame, a station can start the authentication process.
 
For this process, \textcite{kauffels_wireless_2002} names the two methods Open System Authentication and Shared Key Authentication. \textcite{sauter_wireless_2022} explains that Open System Authentication is based on a device making an authentication request to the \ac{AP}. If the \ac{AP} answers with a positive status in the Authentication Frame, the station is included in the \ac{BSS}. The actual encryption and authentication is then performed by the \ac{WPA} functions. The author points out that Shared Key Authentication is no longer used today. 

 the IEEE 802.11 standard describes the two media access methods \ac{DCF} and \ac{PCF}.

\textcite{sauter_wireless_2022} explains that \ac{DCF} is based on the media access method \ac{CSMACA}. In \ac{CSMACA} a device that is willing to transmit senses in the air transmission medium for a transmitting activity. If no other device is transmitting, the device can transmit. In the case of transmit activity, the terminal must wait at least until the transmission and \ac{DIFS} are over.
Since data transmission via the air transmission medium is very vulnerable to errors, the standard IEEE 802.11 requires that each received packet must be confirmed with an \ac{ACK} frame.
The \ac{DIFS} ensures that an \ac{ACK} frame can be sent before another station uses the same channel to send a data frame. 
To avoid multiple devices transmitting at the same time after \ac{DIFS}, each ready-to-transmit device determines a random backoff time. The device with the shortest backoff time transmits next and all other ready-to-transmit devices restart the media access procedure. In case two devices start sending next because they both randomly chose the shortest backoff time, the transmitted signal will interfere and the packets will not be answered with an \ac{ACK} frame.
In case of such a faulty transmission, the backoff time of the ready-to-transmit devices can increase exponentially afterwards.

To share the knowledge of a transmission time and the subsequently interframe space, a packet contains a \ac{NAV} that specifies the time the air transmission medium is used.

In various network architectures the "hidden station"-problem may occur. As you can see in \autoref{fig:hidden_station}, Station A is not able to sense a transmission of station B and vise versa. In case of simultaneous transmission of both stations, interference around the \ac{AP} may occur.

\section{Harvest and Loading Processes as a Use Cases for \ac{WIC}}

\textcite{seifert_feldhacksler_1962} define a forage harvester as an agricultural loading machine for nearly all types of animal feed. By mounting different cutting and loading devices, a forage harvester can load the following types of animal feed according to the authors: Hey, Straw, Corn, Grass and Clover.
While harvesting and loading large quantities of forage, the \ac{FH} needs to load the harvested goods directly onto a \ac{TM}, which drives next to or behind the vehicle. 
Unlike the Combine Harvester, the \ac{FH} cannot store the forage in the tank because the harvested volume is too large. Therefore, a \ac{TM} always drives next to the forage harvester to take over and transport the harvest to the farm.


Taking a corn harvest scenario as an example, key figures can be looked up in \cite{faustzahlen2018}, a standard reference book in agricultural literature. This book contains key figures of agricultural processes, which have been compiled by 80 experts. The key figures, which are shown in \autoref{tab:DataSilageHarvest}, are dependent on the \ac{PPD} and show the large amount of forage harvested by a \ac{FH} every hour.

	\label{tab:DataSilageHarvest}
\end{table}

The harvesting and loading processes are examples for the use of an agricultural platooning system as described by 
\textcite{zhang_method_2009}. This creates a leader and follower system where an unmanned agricultural machine follows a leading manned agricultural machine.

In a harvesting and loading process, the \ac{FH}, as a leader, sets the path and speed and the \ac{TM} follows unmanned with a longitudinal and lateral offset as it is displayed in \autoref{fig:offset}
\begin{figure}%
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/offset_platoon.pdf}
	\caption{Lateral and longitudinal Offset between the two agricultural machines \ac{FH} and \ac{TM} in a corn harvest scenario}%
	\label{fig:offset}%
\end{figure}
This system positions the \ac{TM} optimally to the \ac{FH}, so that the foarge can be loaded ideally from the \ac{FH} onto the \ac{TM}. 

As stated in \autoref{tab:DataSilageHarvest}, already ten drivers for the \ac{TM}s are needed in the corn harvest process with a high \ac{PPD}. 
By using a leader and follower system based on the description of \textcite{zhang_method_2009}, each \ac{TM} can drive unmanned in the field leading to a smaller number of workers needed in the corn harvest process.

	\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{figures/AKLandwirtschaft.pdf}
	\caption{Decrease in the agricultural labor force in Germany \cite{bmel2020}}%
	\label{fig:workforce_agri}%
\end{figure}

At the same time, the harvesting and loading processes are also examples of the video streaming use case. During these processes the spout of the \ac{FH} must be controlled to set the loading position of the forage into the trailer of the \ac{TM}.

According to \textcite{murcia_quadrotor_2014}, different spout guidance and control systems have been developed for this reason, which use a camera attached to the spout to determine the fill volume at each point of the trailer via machine vision and set the spout to fill the empty parts of the trailer accordingly. The author describes Autofill - systems from Claas and Intellifill - systems from CNH Industrial as examples of spout guidance systems. 

Streaming the video of a camera at the spout from the \ac{FH} to the \ac{TM} would be a useful application of the video streaming use case in the harvesting process. If the driver of the \ac{TM} can watch a livestream of the trailer's fill level, he is always informed and knows when the trailer is full and can drive the forage back to the farm.

To gain a better insight into requirements of the\ac{WIC} use cases Platooning and Streaming Services, I analysed process data of a corn harvest scenario as the example for I collected GPS tracks of a \ac{FH} and two to three \ac{TM}s harvesting corn on a field in Germany on two days in September. For this, I placed tablets in the driver's cabs of a \ac{FH} and three \ac{TM}s, which recorded the position and the speed in a NMEA data stream of the tablet's GPS every second.

The workflow for collecting the corn harvest process data was as follows. 
I handed out the tablets to the drivers, which left the farm with the tablets in the driver's cabs to drive to the field in the morning. The tablets recorded position and speed of the \ac{FH} and the \ac{TM}s all day long. During breaks, the tablets continued to capture NMEA data stream of their GPS even if the positions and speed did not change.

After recording the process data, I anonymized it. 
First, I delete data points of the log files where the recorded accuracy was not yet less than \SI{2}{\metre}. When the accuracy of following data points was less than \SI{2}{\metre}, I replaced the timestamp and the date for all data points with a continuous index.

After that I anonymized the location data by adding a random offset to the GPS coordinates. As a result, the areas were moved to a random location in the world.

The goal of analysing the corn harvest data was to investigate the machines move in the working scenarios relative to each other. The speed and distance of the machines in tracked data may result in new use case requirements for e.g. latency or communication range. The machinery movement profile can be used to identify when shadowing effects may occur in the work scenario or when machines meet in the field.

To detect overloading of crops from \ac{FH} to a \ac{TM} in the Harvest Process, I had to develop an intelligent algorithm. It can detect overloading scenarios in the recorded process data.

For this purpose I started to build a Dashboard with the Python framework \textit{Dash}\footnote{https://dash.plotly.com/introduction Accessed: 5.12.2022}. In the Dashboard, I initially plotted all the positions in a polyline for each machine on a map. A slider allows one to set a time interval that narrows down the data points for display in the dashboard. In addition, one could select which \ac{TM}s are displayed next to the \ac{FH}. For the chosen time interval, the distance and velocity difference between the selected \ac{TM}s and the \ac{FH} were plotted in graphs as time histories. 

In the dashboard, I was able to get an overview of the behavior of the machines before, during, after the overloading scenario.
In the overview, it can be seen that a \ac{FH} is nearly always in the overleading process with a \ac{TM}. In doing so, the FH may occasionally stay in the same place if the cutter is clogged or there is a transition of \ac{TM}s where a full \ac{TM} moves away from the \ac{FH} and a empty \ac{TM} catches up to the \ac{FH} to take over the forage.

\textcite{klingler_agriculture_2018} investigated the suitability of IEEE 802.11p for \ac{WIC}. The authors detected that shadowing effects occur in the harvest scenario. The authors explain the effect because either another tractor or the spout of the \ac{FH} was in the \ac{LOS}.  

To get an overview of where a \ac{TM} is in the overloading process relative to the \ac{FH}, I reviewed the recorded position data. The relative bearing is the angle between B and the heading of point A, as shown in \autoref{fig:bearing_plain}. I calculated the relative bearing between the heading of the \ac{FH} and the \ac{TM} at each time point in the overloading scenario.

ATM no pre-built libraries and packages for operating systems
 
The concept of ns3 is based on the abstraction of simulated systems. For this purpose, the term node was introduced for basic computing devices. The Node class offers the possibility to install protocol stacks and applications or to add peripheral cards and mobility models to the node.
Applications are the abstraction of the user-level applications, which represent an activity to be simulated. For this purpose, the applications use resources and functionalities provided by the system software of a node. An example for the
