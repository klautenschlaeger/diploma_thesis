\chapter{Introduction}
%\chapter{Einleitung}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item general motivation for your work, context and goals.
\item context: make sure to link where your work fits in
\item problem: gap in knowledge, too expensive, too slow, a deficiency, superseded technology
\item strategy: the way you will address the problem
\item recommended length: 1-2 pages.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Fundamentals}
\label{sec:fundamentals}


\begin{itemize}
\item describe methods and techniques that build the basis of your work
\item include what's needed to understand your work (e.g., techniques, protocols, models, hardware, software, ...)
\item exclude what's not (e.g., anything you yourself did, anything your reader can be expected to know, ...)
\item review related work(!)
\item recommended length: approximately one third of the thesis.
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Field Measurements}


\chapter{Developed architecture / System design / Implementation / ...}


\begin{itemize}
\item describe everything you yourself did (as opposed to the fundamentals chapter, which explains what you built on)
\item start with a theoretical approach
\item describe the developed system/algorithm/method from a high-level point of view
\item go ahead in presenting your developments in more detail
\item recommended length: approximately one third of the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Simulation}

\chapter{Evaluation}


\begin{itemize}
\item measurement setup / results / evaluation / discussion
\item whatever you have done, you must comment it, compare it to other systems, evaluate it
\item usually, adequate graphs help to show the benefits of your approach
\item each result/graph must not only be described, but also discussed (What's the reason for this peak? Why have you observed this effect? What does this tell about your architecture/system/implementation?)
\item recommended length: approximately one third of the thesis.
\end{itemize}



\chapter{Conclusion}


\begin{itemize}
\item summarize again what your paper did, but now emphasize more the results, and comparisons
\item write conclusions that can be drawn from the results found and the discussion presented in the paper
\item future work (be very brief, explain what, but not much how, do not speculate about results or impact)
\item recommended length: one page.
