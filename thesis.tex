\section{Wireless Lans according to IEEE 802.11}


According to \textcite[41]{kauffels_wireless_2002}, the first version of the Standard IEEE 802.11 was published in 1999 to enable a wireless alternative to Ethernet - or Token-Ring - networks.
\textcite[265-268]{sauter_wireless_2022} considers IEEE 802.11 also to be an implementation of Ethernet with the help of wirless radio technologies.
The author lists the extensions to the original standard, which range from 802.11b, 802.11g, 802.11a, 802.11n, 802.11ac to the latest enhancement 802.11ax. The different IEEE 802.11 standards can operate in the  \SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz} - , \SI{5}{\giga\hertz} and \SI{6}{\giga\hertz} - frequency band.
IEEE 802.11n is also known as \ac{HT} Wi-Fi \cite{ieee_standard_2009n}, IEEE 802.11ac as \ac{VHT} Wi-Fi \cite{ieee_standard_2020} and IEEE 802.11ax as \ac{HE} Wi-Fi \cite{ieee_standard_2021ax}.
The standards are acknowledged by these names.
In addition, they are also called Wi-Fi 4, Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 respectively.
\textcite{jacob_system-level_2020} adds that there are also two extensions IEEE 802.11p and its successor IEEE 802.11bd. These operate in a reserved frequency spectrum for \ac{V2X} according to the authors in the \SI{5.9}{\giga\hertz} frequency spectrum.

\textcite[42,43,178-180]{kauffels_wireless_2002} defines the following three basic architectures for IEEE 802.11.

If two or more \acp{STA} communicate directly without an \ac{AP}, they form an ad hoc network.
According to the author, this can be set up quickly and easily and is called \ac{IBSS}.

The Infrastructure \ac{BSS} mode allows all \ac{STA}s within the range of defined range around the \ac{AP} to communicate via a central \ac{AP}. Within the area of the \ac{BSS}, all stations can move freely and communicate with one another.

Since an \ac{AP} has limited range and can only cover a certain area, the \ac{ESS} was introduced.
It contains a distribution system, which links several \ac{BSS} with each other.

Thereby, the BSS coverage areas can physically overlap so that continuous connection of stations within the ESS can be provided.
For a better performance the \ac{BSS} can be physically placed on top of each other.
One can also have objectively separate \ac{BSS}s so that these \ac{BSS}s can be linked together over long distances.
According to the author, the standard does not specify a distance limit for such connections.

He also mentions that the standard defines the following three mobility types for station in an \ac{ESS}, where a station can do no-transition and thereby stay within a \ac{BSS}, \ac{BSS}-transitioning and move from one \ac{BSS} to another \ac{BSS} within the same \ac{ESS} and \ac{ESS}-transition, where the Station moves from an \ac{ESS} to another one but no stable connection can be guaranteed.

\textcite[272, 273]{sauter_wireless_2022} adds that usually Ethernet is used to link \ac{AP}s within an \ac{ESS}.
But according to the author this can be replaced by a wireless connection, which is called wireless bridge.

To enable communication between Wi-Fi devices, the IEEE 802.11 standard defines the physical and the MAC layer of the OSI model. The first layer is the physical layer.

\chapter{Link Level Simulation}

Simulations benefit from the flexibility and possibility of simulating different communication and network protocols \cite{kumar_simulators_2012}.

Simulations are considered the main evaluation method for IEEE 802.11ax networks by the IEEE 802.11ax task group \cite{omar_survey_2016}.

The authors distinguish between link-level and system-level simulations for simulating \ac{HE} wireless networks.
The authors explain both methods as follows.

For system-level simulation, it requires abstractions of the physical and MAC layers to simulate a system close to
real on this basis.

Link-level simulations, according to the authors,
investigate the performance of the \ac{HE} physical layer for different physical layer parameters as \ac{PER} in terms of \ac{SNR}.
As an example, the authors cite multiple different researchers, which simulated \ac{PER} regarding \ac{SNR} and chosen \ac{MCS}.

\section{Link Level Simulation Evaluation}

The past two sections gave an overview of impact of the different parameters on the achievable goodput and robustness of the IEEE 802.11ax standard.
Both simulations were based on nearly ideal conditions, where the channel was not affected by any interference from other devices.

The results show the complex interplay of the different parameters in regards of the achievable goodput and robustness.
Every mentioned parameter can be set to have the highest possible data rate, which may lead to a low robustness and vice versa.
When the communication link is less robust, more retransmissions are required, which may result in a lower goodput.
When the configured data rate is too low, the goodput is also reduced.

As every application has different requirements on
latency, range, robustness and goodput, the parameters can be configured accordingly.

In general, modern Wi-Fi offer a variety of different parameters, to achieve the best possible performance for the specific application.
The new IEEE 802.11ax \ac{ER} mode combined with \ac{DCM} offers the highest robustness at low \ac{SNR}s according to my simulations, which can
be used for long range applications. The robustness simulation indicated, that the \ac{ER} mode and \ac{DCM} could extend the range, which was measured in the field experiment.

To deal with intersymbol interferences due to multipath effects, which were considered as the main reason for a high \ac{PER} in  Wi-Fi outdoor networks by
\cite{sheth_packet_2007} and \cite{aguayo_link-level_2004}, IEEE 802.11ax offers longer \ac{GI}s of up to \SI{3200}{\nano\second}.
My simulations show that \ac{GI} of \SI{3200}{\nano\second} is more robust against multipath effects than \ac{GI} of \SI{800}{\nano\second}, but
reduces the theoretical achievable data rate.

Since IEEE 802.11n, the robustness of the communication link can be increased by applying \ac{STBC}.
But just as the IEEE 802.11ax \ac{DCM} mode, the
increased robustness comes at the cost of a reduced theoretical data rate.

The following chapter analyses the impact of the different physical layer parameters on the latency of the Application Layer.

\begin{itemize}
\item measurement setup / results / evaluation / discussion
\item whatever you have done, you must comment it, compare it to other systems, evaluate it
\item usually, adequate graphs help to show the benefits of your approach
\item each result/graph must not only be described, but also discussed (What's the reason for this peak? Why have you observed this effect? What does this tell about your architecture/system/implementation?)
\item recommended length: approximately one third of the thesis.
