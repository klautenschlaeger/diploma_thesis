	abstract = {Several service applications have been reported by many who proposed the use of wireless LANs (WLANs) over a wide variety of outdoor deployments. In particular, the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah WLAN protocol will enable a longer transmission range between WLAN access points (APs) and stations (STAs) up to multiple kilometers using carrier frequencies at 900 MHz. However, limitations of WLAN outdoor installations have been found of the plethora of WLAN protocols in experimental studies. This article summarizes the challenges and provides a comprehensive overview of suggested improvements. As the standardization of the IEEE 802.11ah is reaching its final stage, important protocol aspects as well as new features are to be outlined. Interference problems and issues with the WLAN configuration, the physical layer (PHY), and media access control (MAC) are of paramount importance in outdoor WLAN networks, and thus, are discussed in detail. Further, we examine the reported upper boundaries in throughput and link reliability of long-range WLANs in different environments, including sea-surfaces, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and tunnels. At the end of this study, we reflect on the major issues regarding sub-1 GHz (S1G) WLANs and propose avenues for further research.},

	abstract = {This paper presents various perspectives on designing and implementing a communication platform for a teleoperated mobile robot. The deployment of a communication network for a mobile robot and the integration of robot components in the developed communication platform are discussed in this article. A Wi-Fi-based communication network has been established, and to secure remote control over long distances, Internet-based communication via the 4G protocol has been launched using a virtual private network setup. Since an unstable network can damage the robot or the surrounding environment, an algorithm has been developed to monitor the state of the network connection through different protocols. The developed algorithm is able to detect network failure independently of the wireless communication technology used and notify the system of any disruptive communication. The robot's primary reactions to connection failure have been programmed to keep the robot under control until the communication with the control station is restored. Various experiments were carried out to validate the performance of the designed algorithm and statistical analysis was performed for each experiment. One of the main contributions of this study is the development of an algorithm for communication between the mobile robot and the control station based on both Wi-Fi and 4G, which is capable to keep the robot behavior safe and reliable in the presence of an unstable network or connection failure.},

	doi = {10.1109/INFCOM.2007.44},
	abstract = {Despite the increasing number of WiFi-based Long Distance (WiLD) network deployments, there is a lack of understanding of how WiLD networks perform in practice. In this paper, we perform a systematic study to investigate the commonly cited sources of packet loss induced by the wireless channel and by the 802.11 MAC protocol. The channel induced losses that we study are external WiFi, non-WiFi and multipath interference. The protocol induced losses that we study are protocol timeouts and the breakdown of CSMA over WiLD links. Our results are based on measurements performed on two real-world WiLD deployments and a wireless channel emulator. The two deployments allow us to compare measurements across rural and urban settings. The channel emulator allows us to study each source of packet loss in isolation in a controlled environment. Based on our experiments we observe that the presence of external WiFi interference leads to significant amount of packet loss in WiLD links. In addition to identifying the sources of packet loss, we analyze the loss variability across time. We also explore the solution space and propose a range of MAC and network layer adaptation algorithms to mitigate the channel and protocol induced losses. The key lessons from this study were also used in the design of a TDMA based MAC protocol for high performance long distance multihop wireless networks [12].},

In most applications some sort of communication link is needed to transmit telemetry and payload data.

In order to overcome this constraint we investigate the usability of existing cellular networks. Considering these UAVs to communicate by means of cellular networks for establishing reliable air-to-ground links, claims an analysis and evaluation of the cellular channel characteristics in the low altitude operational area. In this paper we present a coverage analysis for cellular networks for altitudes up to 500 m based on aerial RSSI measurements.},

In a set of field experiments, we record the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and measure the raw link-layer throughput for various antenna orientations, communication distances and ground-station elevations. By comparing the performance of 32 simultaneous pairs of UAV and ground station configurations, we are able to conclude that, in order to achieve the highest throughput under a typical flyover UAV flight path, both the UAV and the ground station should use omni-directional dipole (as opposed to high-gain, narrow- beam) antennas positioned horizontally, with their respective antenna null pointing to a direction perpendicular to the UAV's flight path. In addition, a moderate amount of elevation of the ground stations can also improve performance significantly.},

	abstract = {Many rural and remote communities around the world see themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide. In particular, there is evidence to suggest that there is a growing digital divide between urban and rural areas in terms of broadband Internet access with people living in rural areas having fewer choices and pay higher prices for slower speeds. This is true even in developed countries. Motivated by the above observations, there has been an increasing interest in deploying and researching low cost rural wireless networks with active community participation. This paper presents an overview of our efforts in this direction in deploying a rural WiFibased long distance mesh network testbed in the Scottish Highlands and Islands. We highlight the unique aspects of our testbed that differentiate it from other existing rural wireless testbeds. We also outline some of the research issues that are currently being investigated in this project.},

Although deployments in this setting are increasing, a systematic study of the performance of 802.11 in these settings is lacking. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: (a)we present a detailed performance study of a set of long-distance 802.11b links at various layers of the network stack, and (b)we document the various non-obvious experiences during our study.Our study includes eight long-distance links, ranging from 1km to 37km in length. Unlike prior studies of outdoor 802.11 links, we find that the error rate as a function of the received signal strength behaves close to theory. Time correlation of any packet errors is negligible across a range of time-scales. We have observed at least one of the link to be robust to rain and fog. But any interference on the long-distance links can be detrimental to performance. Apart from this however, such long-distance links can be planned to work well with predictable performance. During our measurements, we have observed a few hardware/driver quirks as well as system bottlenecks apart from the wireless link itself. We believe that our measurements and the documentation of our experience will help future network planning as well as protocol design for these networks.},

The patterns and causes of loss are important in the design of routing and error-correction protocols, as well as in network planning.The paper makes the following observations. The distribution of inter-node loss rates is relatively uniform over the whole range of loss rates; there is no clear threshold separating "in range" and "out of range." Most links have relatively stable loss rates from one second to the next, though a small minority have very bursty losses at that time scale. Signal-to-noise ratio and distance have little predictive value for loss rate. The large number of links with intermediate loss rates is probably due to multi-path fading rather than attenuation or interference.The phenomena discussed here are all well-known. The contributions of this paper are an understanding of their relative importance, of how they interact, and of the implications for MAC and routing protocol design.},
