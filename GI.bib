	abstract = {The Telecommunication group, at the University of Twente, is working under the WALNUT project, on developing new ways of communication using noise-based transmit-reference (TR) modulation. TR modulation is a technique where a linear combination of the spreading signal and the spread signal, separated by a small frequency offset, are sent over a channel. By using this technique, no complex receiver scheme has to be implemented, because the spreading signal is also received. 
The performance of such a communication system will be reduced by the detrimental effect of inter-symbol interference (ISI). ISI is the interference of adjacent symbols caused by the signals arriving at different time lags due to the multipath behaviour of the channel. In this report, ISI and techniques to prevent ISI are studied. After a small literature research of the ISI prevention technique, two techniques were chosen to investigate: root-raised cosine (RRC) filtering and the use of a guard interval. At first, a simple multipath situation is simulated by only considering a 2-path. On this situation the two ISI prevention techniques are applied and it was found that both techniques show promising results. This specific 2-path was then further adapted into a general multipath, where the delay spread of the channel is dependent on which environment that is simulated. The channel in this situation is considered deterministic. On this multipath situation again both techniques were applied and it was found that the guard interval shows an improvement on the performance of the system. The RRC technique however shows no change in performance when compared to the general case without an ISI prevention technique.},

	abstract = {Objectives: In this paper, the performance parameters in the WLANs are discussed and we evaluate the superior performance of the new IEEE 802.11ac standard with respect to 802.11n. Methods/Analysis: NS3 is an open source network simulator, the latest version of which (ns-3.24.1) has been appended with features to support 802.11ac. Simulations are performed in NS3 to demonstrate the superior performance of the new 802.11ac standard with respect to 802.11n. Features verified are channel bonding, guard interval and MCS while performance is measured with parameters such as jitter, throughput and delay. Findings: IEEE 802.11ac is a Very High Throughput (VHT) WLAN standard that can achieve data rates in the order of 7 Gbps in the 5 GHz band. This has been achieved by enhancing the features in the earlier IEEE 802.11n standard in the MAC and PHY layers. The simulations reveal improvement in throughput, delay and jitter performance with usage of increased bandwidths.},

	abstract = {Intercarrier Interference (ICI) is an impairment well known to degrade performance of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) transmissions. It arises from carrier frequency offsets (CFOs), from the Doppler spread due to channel time-variation and, to a lesser extent, from sampling frequency offsets (SFOs). Literature reports several models of ICI due to each kind of impairment. Some studies describe ICI due to two of the three impairments, but so far no general model exists to describe the joint effect of all three impairments together. Furthermore, most available models involve some level of approximation, and the diversity of approaches makes it cumbersome to compare power levels of the different kinds of ICI. In this work, we present a general and mathematically exact model for the ICI stemming from the joint effect of the three impairments mentioned. The model allows for a vis-a-vis comparison of signal-to-ICI ratios (SIRs) caused by each impairment. Our result was validated by simulations. An analysis of ICI in IEEE-802.16e-type transmissions shows that during steady-state tracking and at speeds below 150 km/h, SIR due to CFO is typically in the range between 25 dB and 35 dB, SIR due to Doppler spread is larger than 25 dB, and ICI due to SFO is negligible.},

The ﬁrst one describes the behaviour inside the guard interval, the other outside. Assuming the channel to be widesense stationary with uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS), the linear characteristic of Fourier transformation allows to obtain the mathematical expressions of intercarrier interference (ICI) power PICI, intersymbol interference (ISI) power PISI and useful power PU in dependence of the correlation functions and the multi-path channel proﬁles of two truncated channels exactly. In this paper, we consider only the case of the time-invariant channel. The simulation results show a good agreement with the theoretical results.},

	abstract = {As the type of transmitted data over communication networks started to shift from the human-generated to massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTCs), entirely new applications within the Internet of Things (IoT) market emerged. Recently introduced Cellular IoT (CIoT) communication technologies operating in the licensed frequency spectrum (i.e., Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and LTE-M) complemented the already implemented and ﬁeld-tested technologies (e.g., LoRa(WAN) and Sigfox) transmitting data in license-exempt frequency bands. Owing to the licensed spectrum as well as to the standardization efforts put by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the CIoT technologies are supposed to handle the massive number of data transmissions by introducing new categories of communication devices. In this regard, this paper elaborates on the critical parameters of the LTE Cat-M introduced by 3GPP. Along with the highlights of the technology in question, the implementation of LTE Cat-M1 in Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) is presented. Out of the obtained simulation data, the focus is primarily given to the network capacity for mMTC scenarios while utilizing the LTE Cat-M technology. What is even more, the side-by-side evaluation with legacy LTE/LTE-A systems is provided.},

	abstract = {IEEE 802.11n is a high-speed wireless broadband local area networking standard. IEEE 802.11n-based devices are using some kind of adaptive modulation-coding (AMC) scheme to adjust its transmission rate according to the radio channel condition. In these devices, however, the concept of guard interval adaptation is not been considered. Normally, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology-based systems are using the guard interval much greater than the length of the channel impulse response. However, many previous works have shown that the choice of the larger guard interval is inefficient in terms of achievable throughput. IEEE802.11n supports using two guard intervals (short = 400 ns or long = 800 ns). Indeed, the shorter guard interval evidently results in intersymbol interference (ISI) and intercarrier interference (ICI), but the gain offered by shortened guard interval may exceed the loss caused by interference. In this paper, we propose a novel but simple solution for the guard interval adaptation joint with an adaptive modulation-coding scheme to optimize the throughput performance of a wireless local area network (WLAN) system. This paper aims to analyze the effect of joint adaptive modulation-coding and the guard interval (JAMCGI) algorithm on the WLAN system under bit-error-rate (BER) constraints. Simulation results and their analysis show a significant increase in the throughput performance of the WLAN system with our proposed algorithm.},

Specifically, the tradeoff between throughput and ICI/ISI (intercarrier interference/intersymbol interference), which affects the length of the guard interval (GI) is well known. Many equalization methods that decrease the interference for a given (short) GI have been proposed. However, it seems that the exact expressions for the ICI and ISI have never been derived. In this paper these expressions are derived for a general (per tone equalization) setup. Often, the matched filter bound (MFB) for single carrier systems is used for OFDM systems. We make two new observations. First, we prove that under mild conditions, met in common scenarios, the ICI power and the ISI power are approximately equal. Second, we show by example that the MFB does not necessarily hold for OFDM. Both cyclic prefix (CP) and zeros prefix (ZP) are examined.},
