	abstract = {IoT applications rely strongly on the performance of wireless communication networks. There is a wide variety of wireless IoT technologies and choosing one over another depends on the specific use case requirements—be they technical, implementation-related or functional factors. Among the technical factors, latency, error rate and stability are the main parameters that affect communication reliability. In this work, we present the design, development and validation of a Universal Testbed to experimentally measure these parameters, abstracting them from the wireless IoT technology protocols and hardware platforms. The Testbed setup, which is based on a Raspberry Pi 4, only requires the IoT device under test to have digital inputs. We evaluate the Testbed’s accuracy with a temporal characterisation—accumulated response delay—showing an error less than 290 µs, leading to a relative error around 3\% for the latencies of most IoT wireless technologies, the latencies of which are usually on the order of tens of milliseconds. Finally, we validate the Testbed’s performance by comparing the latency, error and stability measurements with those expected for the most common IoT wireless technologies: 6LoWPAN, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, BLE and NB-IoT.},

	doi = {10.1109/ISCIT.2014.7011912},
	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a multi-mode low density parity check (LDPC) decoder architecture for high throughput wireless communication systems. Throughput of our decoder depends on code rate. The main blocks of our architecture are independent from value of the check matrix. Based on the proposed architecture, we design a twelve-mode Min-Sum LDPC decoder for IEEE 802.11ac system and synthesize it in ASIC 90nm technology. The ASIC synthesis results show that our decoder achieves up to 15.4 bits/cycle (bpc) or 7.7 Gbps at 500 MHz operating frequency, and has the best efficiency which is 1.89 (bpc/mm2) as compared to the previous works. In this paper, we also propose an efficient quantization method that can significantly improve the PER performance. The floating point and fixed point simulation results show that PER performance of the 802.11ac system is improved by at least 1 dB if using LDPC instead of BCC. Furthermore, the proposed quantization method can improve the LDPC PER performance up to 1.7 dB.},
