	doi = {10.1109/COMSNETS53615.2022.9668513},
	abstract = {This paper investigates the application of the Received Bit Information Rate (RBIR) mapping technique to abstract the physical (PHY) layer in performing rate adaptation for IEEE WLAN 802.11ax systems. We observe that the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) obtained by PHY Layer Abstraction (PLA) is too conservative when used in practice. Motivated by this observation, we propose Hybrid Channel-Dependent Rate Adaptation (HCDRA) to map the measured SNR to an MCS value that maximizes the throughput while keeping the average Packet Error Rate (PER) below a threshold value. We evaluate HCDRA for a user on a Resource Unit (RU) in the OFDMA mode of transmission. The proposal of channel-dependent rate adaptation in OFDMA mode of transmission for IEEE WLAN 802.11ax is novel to the best of our knowledge. We implement and evaluate HCDRA in the standard-compliant MATLAB WLAN Toolbox and compare its performance with other well-known rate adaptation algorithms such as Automatic Rate Fallback (ARF), Adaptive ARF (AARF), Minstrel, and MutFed. More realistic situations with PHY impairments such as carrier frequency offset (CFO) and symbol timing offset are considered in all our simulations. Results show that HCDRA has better throughput performance compared to the four other algorithms we have evaluated. HCDRA is eminently implementable without any modification in the standard frames, and hence it is suitable for practical deployment.},

	abstract = {Packet-level wireless (802.11ax or 5G) network simulators face escalating system dimensionality resulting from dense deployment scenarios supporting wideband, Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO), Multi-User (MU) transmission. Managing the resulting network simulation complexity and achieving practical runtimes require continuing enhancements to physical (PHY) layer abstractions. This work improves the state-of-the-art PHY layer abstractions via a new computational workflow that maps extensive offline link simulation results for OFDM/OFDMA MIMO/MU-MIMO system performance over frequency-selective fading channels into Packet Error Ratio (PER) for network simulations. The proposed method is shown to require modest additional storage and the runtime is insensitive to the increase in PHY layer dimensionality. We describe the principles of this new method and provide details about its implementation, performance, and validation.},

	abstract = {As most existing work investigate the PHY layer abstraction under an assumption of perfect channel estimation, it may become unreliable if there exists channel estimation error in a real communication system. This letter improves an efficient PHY layer method, EESM-log-SGN PHY layer abstraction, by considering the presence of channel estimation error. We develop two methods for implementing the EESM-log-SGN PHY abstraction under imperfect channel estimation. We show that the effective SINR is not impacted by the channel estimation error under multiple-input and single-output (MISO)/single-input and single-output (SISO) configuration, which is also verified by the full PHY simulation. The developed methods are then validated under different orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scenarios.},
