\begin{itemize}
\item summarize again what your paper did, but now emphasize more the results, and comparisons
\item write conclusions that can be drawn from the results found and the discussion presented in the paper
\item future work (be very brief, explain what, but not much how, do not speculate about results or impact)
\item recommended length: one page.

This thesis investigates the suitability of modern Wi-Fi for \ac{WIC}, which describes a wireless process data exchange between agricultural machines in the field.
The investigation is based on the example use cases Agricultural Platooning Service,
which enables the exchange of process data to guide a vehicle in a platoon with a lateral and longitudinal
offset to a leading vehicle  in the field.
Agricultural platooning services can be used to position \ac{TM}s to optimize the loading of forage by \ac{FH}s.
This thesis investigates the suitability of modern Wi-Fi for \ac{WIC} taking the example of the Agricultural platooning service.
\ac{WIC} will be used to exchange guidance data between a \ac{FH} and a \ac{TM} for the positioning of overloaded grain.

Future work could investigate whether Wi-Fi can be used for other use cases of \ac{WIC}.
