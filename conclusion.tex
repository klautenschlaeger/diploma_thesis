This thesis investigates the suitability of modern Wi-Fi for \ac{WIC}, which describes a wireless process data exchange between agricultural machines in the field.
The investigation is based on the prototypical application Agricultural Platooning Service in the corn harvest scenario.
Agricultural Platooning Services exchange of process data via \ac{WIC} to guide a vehicle in a platoon with lateral and longitudinal
offset to a leading vehicle in the field.
Agricultural Platooning Services can be used to guide \ac{TM}s to optimal forage overloading position of \ac{FH}s in the corn harvest.

I analyzed corn harvest process data, which indicated that the overloading position is usually at a distance of \SIrange{5}{6}{\meter} at every angle relative to the \ac{FH}.

A field measurement campaign in the corn harvest scenario indicated that the signal strength of Wi-Fi suffers from shadowing effects due to the machine sizes and
multipath effects introduce additional interferences, which leaded to a \ac{PER} of \SI{30.0}{\percent}.
Additionally, I tested the Wi-Fi range in a farming environment and found out that a communication range of \SI{820}{\meter} for the \SI{5}{\giga\hertz} band and \SI{1.2}{\kilo\meter} for the \SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz} band
at a \ac{PER} of \SI{10.0}{\percent} is possible. \todo{Werte sind Wunschvorstellungen, die aber mit den Ergebnissen aus dem Feldtest nach deren Durchf√ºhrung korregiert werden.}

I simulated different Wi-Fi physical layer configurations to analyze their impact on data rate and robustness.
IEEE 802.11ax introduces the new \ac{ER} mode, which enables a robust and long-range communication for service discovery transmission when used with \ac{DCM}.
The \ac{GI} of \SI{3.2}{\micro\second} in IEEE 802.11ax can be used to combat intersymbol interferences due to multipath effects in the agricultural environment.
The guidance data exchange mode can be configured to use low \ac{MCS} like \ac{HE}-\ac{MCS}3 with \ac{STBC} and \ac{LDPC} to achieve a robust communication,
which enables the \ac{WIC} to meet the required latencies and message intervals for Agricultural Platooning Services in the corn harvest scenario.

    Wi-Fi offers a wide range of physical layer configurations, which can be used to reduce the data rate and enable robust communication.

    Future work could investigate whether modern Wi-Fi can be used for other \ac{WIC} use cases.
    IEEE 802.11bd is a new standard, which is designed for \ac{WIC} in the industrial domain.
