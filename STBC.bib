	abstract = {Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) represent a recent, exciting development in the ﬁeld of physical layer (PHY) data transmission. By employing more than one antenna at the transmitter, and by properly coding data across the transmit antennas, STBC-equipped PHYs promise increased data rates with minimal decoding complexity at the receiver. This article presents a comprehensive study of how the STBC gains at the PHY translate to signiﬁcant network performance improvement in 802.11a Wireless LANs. We base our study on a detailed, across-all-layers, simulation of an 802.11a system; we have extended the ns simulator with an implementation of the 802.11a PHY, which allows us to assess the impact of STBC not only at the PHY layer, but at the higher layers as well. An extensive set of simulations illustrates the merits of STBC, and sheds light on how performance can be improved for TCP trafﬁc. Essentially, STBC presents to TCP a “smoother” wireless channel; the latter phenomenon is corroborated by a brief theoretical analysis as well.},

	abstract = {Wireless designers constantly seek to improve the spectrum efficiency/capacity, coverage of wireless networks and link reliability. Space-time wireless technology that uses multiple antennas along with appropriate signalling and receiver techniques offers a powerful tool for improving wireless performance. More advanced MIMO techniques are planned for future mobile networks in wireless Local Area Network (LANs) and Wide Area Network (WANs). Multiple antennas when used with appropriate Space-Time Coding (STC) techniques can achieve huge performance gains in multipath fading wireless links. The Space Time Coding has evolved as a most vibrant research area in wireless communications. Recently, Space-Time Block Coding (STBC) has been trying to incorporate in the forthcoming generation of mobile communication standard which aims to deliver true multimedia capability. This paper presents the Space-Time Block Codes (STBC) for wireless networks that uses multiple numbers of antennas at both transmitter and receiver. The simulations have been done in MATLAB. The STBC which includes the Alamouti Scheme as well as an orthogonal STBC for 4 transmit antenna case has been simulated and studied.},

	abstract = {Multicarrier modulation can be implemented by using Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) to achieve utmost bandwidth exploitation and soaring alleviation attributes profile besides multipath fading. To support delay sensitive and band bandwidth demanding multimedia applications and internet services, MIMO in addition with other techniques can be used to achieve high capacity and reliability. To obtain high spatial rate by transmitting data on several antennas by using MIMO with OFDM results in reducing error recovery features and the equalization complexities arise by sending data on varying frequency levels. Three parameters frequency OFDM, Spatial (MIMO) and time (STC) can be used to achieve diversity in MIMO-OFDM. This technique is dynamic and well-known for services of wireless broadband access. MIMO if used with OFDM is highly beneficial for each scheme and provides high throughput. There are several space time block codes to exploit MIMO OFDM; one of the techniques is called Alamouti Codes. The paper investigates adaptive Alamouti Codes and their application in IEEE 802.11n.},

	doi = {10.1109/18.771146},
	abstract = {We introduce space-time block coding, a new paradigm for communication over Rayleigh fading channels using multiple transmit antennas. Data is encoded using a space-time block code and the encoded data is split into n streams which are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The received signal at each receive antenna is a linear superposition of the n transmitted signals perturbed by noise. Maximum-likelihood decoding is achieved in a simple way through decoupling of the signals transmitted from different antennas rather than joint detection. This uses the orthogonal structure of the space-time block code and gives a maximum-likelihood decoding algorithm which is based only on linear processing at the receiver. Space-time block codes are designed to achieve the maximum diversity order for a given number of transmit and receive antennas subject to the constraint of having a simple decoding algorithm. The classical mathematical framework of orthogonal designs is applied to construct space-time block codes. It is shown that space-time block codes constructed in this way only exist for few sporadic values of n. Subsequently, a generalization of orthogonal designs is shown to provide space-time block codes for both real and complex constellations for any number of transmit antennas. These codes achieve the maximum possible transmission rate for any number of transmit antennas using any arbitrary real constellation such as PAM. For an arbitrary complex constellation such as PSK and QAM, space-time block codes are designed that achieve 1/2 of the maximum possible transmission rate for any number of transmit antennas. For the specific cases of two, three, and four transmit antennas, space-time block codes are designed that achieve, respectively, all, 3/4, and 3/4 of maximum possible transmission rate using arbitrary complex constellations. The best tradeoff between the decoding delay and the number of transmit antennas is also computed and it is shown that many of the codes presented here are optimal in this sense as well.},

The design aspect of wireless system aims at improvement in spectral efficiency and coverage area with reliable performance. This necessitates that the MIMO system must be capable to overcome data rate limitation and there must have options open for future improvement. Error performance and spectral efficiency can further be improved by incorporating STBC with MIMO system. Recently many researchers have been working on MIMO systems with STBC to improve the performance of system without additional bandwidth or transmit power requirements. We have considered here the STBC schemes in Ricean fading environment using various combinations of numbers of transmit and receive antennas. The simulations results have been obtained in MATLAB platform. The bit error rate performance has been analyzed for the Ricean factors of k = 0,1, and 10 in 16 QAM modulation schemes.},
