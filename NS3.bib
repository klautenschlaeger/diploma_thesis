	abstract = {VANET (Vehicular Ad hoc Network) is a special kind of ad hoc network in which each vehicle is regarded as a communication unit, which has attracted lots of attention in recent years. Vehicle's movement is restricted by road and environment in VANET, while traditional random mobility model and way-point mobility model can't reflect the realistic vehicle traces. How to evaluate wireless routing protocol in VANET based on real dynamic vehicle traces? In this paper, we have studied the communication methods between road traffic simulator SUMO(Simulation of Urban Mobility) and network simulator NS3. By establishing a feedback loop between them, we successfully build a coordination protocol to combine the traffic simulation power of SUMO and the network simulation capability of NS3. Finally, we present two scenarios to illustrate how our methods can simulate real VANET environment smoothly.},

	abstract = {Complexity of current computer networks, including e.g., local networks, large structured networks, wireless sensor networks, datacenter backbones, requires a thorough study to perform analysis and support design. Simulation is a tool of paramount importance to encompass all the different aspects that contribute to design quality and network performance (including as well energy issues, security management overheads, dependability), due to the fact that such complexity produces several interactions at all network layers that is not easily modellable with analytic approaches. In this systematic literature review we aim to analyze, basing our investigation on available literature, the adoption of a popular network simulator, namely ns-3, and its use in the scientific community. More in detail, we are interested in understanding what are the impacted application domains in which authors prefer ns-3 to other similar tools and how extensible it is in practice according to the experience of authors. The results of our analysis, which has been conducted by especially focusing on 128 papers published between 2009 to 2019, reveals that 10\% of the evaluated papers were discarded because they represented informal literature; most of the studies presented comparisons among different network simulators, beyond ns-3 and conceptual studies related to performance assessment and validation and routing protocols. Only about 30\% of considered studies present extensions of ns-3 in terms of new modules and only about 10\% present effective case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of employing network simulator in real application, except conceptual and modeling studies.},

In this paper, we present a new and flexible visualization tool for ns-3, called NetSimulyzer, that can alleviate the workload of debugging, understanding, and demonstrating a scenario. The tool was conceived to easily integrate to any ns-3 scenario and provides core functionalities that are technology agnostic. NetSimulyzer provides mechanisms to track a variety of simulation elements, from topology and node mobility, to statistics and other data generated by the simulated network protocols. The collected information can be visualized using a 3D scene augmented with data visualization elements such as charts and logs. In this paper, we provide an overview of the architecture and functionalities of the tool, and we also illustrate its usability and versatility by visualizing scenarios provided in the standard ns-3 distribution.},

	abstract = {With increasing demand for wireless networks, the number of technologies that allow us to connect remote devices has increased as well. One of the more common technologies that allows us to connect two remote devices with each other is WiFi, which provides high power, short-range connection between devices. In order to transfer data using WiFi over a longer distance, it is common to use Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), which provides an infrastructureless network that can be used for long range communication in the cases where infrastructure-based networks are unavailable. Another, more recent and less common way to connect remote devices without relying on pre-existing infrastructure is by using LoRa, which provides low power, long-range wireless connection. In this paper, we analyze the performance of WiFi Ad Hoc and LoRa networks using Network Simulator 3 (ns-3) in terms of delay and energy consumption required to send a file of a given size as we vary the distance from the source to the destination. In addition, we develop mathematical models for the delay and energy consumption, and compare these models with the results obtained through simulation. Our results show which network protocol, WiFi Ad Hoc or LoRa, provides the lowest delay or the least energy consumption for a given file size and distance, which can be used to adaptively select the communication protocol to optimize the network performance.},

	abstract = {The emerging paradigm of the Internet of Everything, along with the increasing demand of Internet services everywhere, results in a remarkable and continuous growth of the global Internet traffic. As a cost-effective Internet access solution, WiFi networks currently generate a major portion of the global Internet traffic. Furthermore, the number of WiFi public hotspots worldwide is expected to increase by more than sevenfold by 2018. To face this huge increase in the number of densely deployed WiFi networks, and the massive amount of data to be supported by these networks in indoor and outdoor environments, it is necessary to improve the current WiFi standard and define specifications for high efficiency wireless local area networks (HEWs). This paper presents potential techniques that can be applied for HEWs, in order to achieve the required performance in dense HEW deployment scenarios, as expected in the near future. The HEW solutions under consideration includes physical layer techniques, medium access control layer strategies, spatial frequency reuse schemes, and power saving mechanisms. To accurately assess a newly proposed HEW scheme, we discuss suitable evaluation methodologies, by defining simulation scenarios that represent future HEW usage models, performance metrics that reflect HEW user experience, traffic models for dominant HEW applications, and channel models for indoor and outdoor HEW deployments. Finally, we highlight open issues for future HEW research and development.},

This paper reviews the performance of both wireless protocols in the same operating frequency of 5 GHz.

Furthermore, this paper focuses on analyzing and comparing the throughput of protocol IEEE 802.11ax Mcs-11 and 802.11ac Mcs-9 with a certain payload size and a various number of clients. The other parameters are set at certain values, such as a spatial stream, channel width, modulation and coding scheme, guard interval time and simulation time. The simulation result shows that the IEEE protocol 802.11ax Mcs-11 has better throughput performance than IEEE 802.11ac Mcs-9 with a large number of clients.

To meet the demands of high-density networks, the 802.11ax standard uses a novel frequency reuse mechanism known as Basic-Service Set (BSS)-Coloring.

To this end, we have carried out Network-Simulator (NS)-3-based simulation study. Further, we have simulated a multi-BSS environment and studied the performance of throughput due to variation in the following key WLAN parameters: (i) Modulation \& Coding Scheme (MCS) Index, (ii) Channel bandwidth, (iii) Number of antennas, (iv) Access-Categories, and (v) Non-saturated Traffic conditions.},
