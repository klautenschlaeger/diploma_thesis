	abstract = {This paper presents a method to develop an electronic controlled platooning system, which will enable an autonomous agricultural vehicle to follow a leading tractor with a given lateral and longitudinal offset. In our study not only the follow-up motions but also the problems such as avoiding obstacle, turning at the end of the field have been considered. With the aid of the RTK GPS systems the position of the leading tractor can be obtained with accuracy in the range of centimeters. The position points of the leading tractor are transmitted by wireless modems to the following vehicle continually to provide the target position points for the guidance of the following agricultural vehicle. With the method of curve fitting a desired path for the following vehicle could be dynamically created. Based on the target position points and the path planning, the desired speed and the desired steering angle of the following tractor are calculated. In order to ensure the precise navigation of the driverless following tractor, a course tracking controller and a speed controller have to be designed and implemented. In addition to the motion control algorithms which could keep the autonomous agricultural vehicle following the leading tractor, considerations about safety and robustness of the whole platooning control system would be issued at the end of this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the development and experimental validation of a novel grain unloading-on-the-go automation system (automatic offloading) for agricultural combine harvesters. Unloading-on-the-go is desirable during harvest, but it requires highly-skilled and exhausting labor because the combine operator must fulfill multiple tasks simultaneously. The automatic offloading system can unburden the combine operator by automatically monitoring the grain cart fill status, determining the appropriate auger location, and controlling the relative vehicle position and auger on/of. An automation architecture is proposed and experimentally demonstrated to automate the unloading-on-the-go process. To allow for diferent operator-selected unloading scenarios, the automatic offloading controller has three fill strategies and two movement control options, “open-loop” and “closed-loop”. The automatic offloading controller was implemented on a dSPACE MicroAutoBox II and integrated into a combine harvester. In addition, a stereo-camera-based perception system was connected to the automatic offloading controller via an Ethernet cable for grain fill profile measurement during unloading. In-feld testing demonstrated that the automatic offloading system can effectively automate the unloading-on-the-go of a combine harvester to fill a grain cart to the desired level under nominal harvesting conditions.},

In contrast, in this paper we investigate the suitability of plain LoRa and its use for more complex and more demanding applications in the agricultural domain. We describe meshed Automatic Section Control (m-ASC) as a prototypical application of connected vehicles in the agricultural domain. It allows multiple vehicles to conduct the same work in the same field in parallel by selectively turning off sections of their equipment (e.g., individual sprayer nozzles) in regions that have already been cultivated by another vehicle. We conduct both field experiments and computer simulations to investigate the performance of LoRa. We demonstrate that LoRa is a promising basis for this use case, allowing for long-range communication even under Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) conditions and meeting the demands of this example application with ample room for higher-performance and more complex applications.},

In this, a cross-layer-based channel access and routing solution for sensing and actuating is proposed. We analyze the network structure based on coverage range, throughput, and latency.},

	doi = {10.23919/APCC.2017.8304043},
	abstract = {WiFi is starting to be adopted in agricultural settings because of the increasing use of data-centric farming devices and applications. Some of these applications require high data rates that other radio standards cannot offer, for example, realtime yield mapping, drone-based image upload and viewing and video monitoring. It is therefore desirable for farming wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to also utilise available on-farm WiFi networks. However, little information is available on WiFi signal propagation in these environments, as agricultural WSNs have traditionally been based on other radio standards. Therefore, the 2.4GHz WiFi signal propagation characteristics in real outdoor agricultural cropping environments were investigated using infield data loggers. Three distinct farming environments were studied, (i) bare fields, (ii) cotton fields, and (iii) ponded-water rice fields. We studied the effects of (i) weather conditions, (ii) crop growth and (iii) water depth on signal strength across an entire growing season. We also studied the range of reliable data transfer in each environment as a function of height of the logger WiFi antenna above the crop. Crop growth status was found to be much more significant in determining signal strength than weather conditions, with signal strength declining by 8dB over the season in a cotton field, and by 20dB in a rice field. In rice and cotton crops, provided the radios remain 20cm above the crop canopy, ranges in excess of 1km were measured. Significantly greater ranges are predicted if the antenna is more than 40cm above the top of the crop. Regression models were fitted to the measurements to allow predictions and recommendations, with correlation coefficient of determination (R2) values of better than 0.9 in most cases. Radio path loss exponents depended on the environment, and were typically between 3 and 5.},

	abstract = {Several service applications have been reported by many who proposed the use of wireless LANs (WLANs) over a wide variety of outdoor deployments. In particular, the upcoming IEEE 802.11ah WLAN protocol will enable a longer transmission range between WLAN access points (APs) and stations (STAs) up to multiple kilometers using carrier frequencies at 900 MHz. However, limitations of WLAN outdoor installations have been found of the plethora of WLAN protocols in experimental studies. This article summarizes the challenges and provides a comprehensive overview of suggested improvements. As the standardization of the IEEE 802.11ah is reaching its final stage, important protocol aspects as well as new features are to be outlined. Interference problems and issues with the WLAN configuration, the physical layer (PHY), and media access control (MAC) are of paramount importance in outdoor WLAN networks, and thus, are discussed in detail. Further, we examine the reported upper boundaries in throughput and link reliability of long-range WLANs in different environments, including sea-surfaces, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and tunnels. At the end of this study, we reflect on the major issues regarding sub-1 GHz (S1G) WLANs and propose avenues for further research.},
